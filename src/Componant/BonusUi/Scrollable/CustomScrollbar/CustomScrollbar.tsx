            <P>I'm quite interested in learning more about <em className="txt-danger">custom scrollbars</em> because they are becoming more and more common.</P>

              <Image className="img-fluid" src={dynamicImage(`banner/1.jpg`)} alt="banner" />
            </div>
            <P>There are various justifications for customizing a scrollbar. For instance, the default scrollbar can cause an app's user interface to look inconsistent across various operating systems. In this case, having a single style is helpful.</P>
            <P>I never had the opportunity to learn about CSS scrollbar customization, but I have always been interested in doing so. I'll take the chance to learn more about them and share my trip in this essay.</P>
            <P>One crucial point to remember is that, depending on the design, a scrollbar may operate either <em className="txt-danger">horizontally or vertically</em> . Additionally, it might alter when you work on a website that is global and operates in both left-to-right and right-to-left orientations.</P>
